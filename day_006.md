## Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).

```
Example input
3900

Example output
1 65
```
```
N = int(input())
full_hours = str(N // 3600)
full_minutes = str(N // 60)
print("{} {}".format(full_hours,full_minutes)) 
```
